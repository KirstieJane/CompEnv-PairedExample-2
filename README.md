# Computational Environment Example 2

There are three branches in this repository.

* `master` : https://github.com/KirstieJane/CompEnv-PairedExample-2/tree/master
* `branch-a` : https://github.com/KirstieJane/CompEnv-PairedExample-2/tree/branch-1 
* `branch-b` : https://github.com/KirstieJane/CompEnv-PairedExample-2/tree/branch-b

There's an **identical** jupyter notebook in `branch-a` and `branch-b`.
It is generously re-used from [Hannah](https://github.com/story645) from [https://github.com/story645/scraps/blob/master/chap03.ipynb](https://github.com/story645/scraps/blob/master/chap03.ipynb) and she had built that example from [Python Machine Learning 2nd Edition](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-Machine-Learning-Second-Edition/tree/master/Chapter03) by [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/).

* `branch-a` has a requirements file. You can access the binder for that branch at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KirstieJane/CompEnv-PairedExample-2/branch-a
* `branch-b` has a requirements file. You can access the binder for that branch at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KirstieJane/CompEnv-PairedExample-2/branch-b


## Instructions

1. Click the badge above to launch the example.
   (You may wish to right click and select "Open Link in a New Tab" in order to keep these instructions visible.)
   When it has finished loading, a notebook environment will be visible.

2. Run the code!

**Q's:**

* What's different between these two branches?
* What is the difference in the code?
